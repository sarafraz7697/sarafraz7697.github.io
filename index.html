      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        From the age of 14, I’ve been deeply passionate about software
        engineering and problem-solving. My journey began with a simple yet
        powerful interest in World of Warcraft. Along with my friends, I dove
        into the world of online gaming, where we decided to create our own
        private server. Back then, we didn’t know much about coding, but with
        determination and a lot of research, we discovered the magic of repacks
        for World of Warcraft servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I had no experience in Lua, the scripting language used for WoW
        servers, we began experimenting. Through testing, troubleshooting, and
        learning as we went, we were able to create our first Lua script that
        showed a simple in-game menu with teleporting options, a basic buy
        center, and other features. This was my first taste of coding, and it
        was exhilarating to modify game mechanics, write scripts, and even
        interact with MySQL databases—without knowing much about programming or
        databases at the time!
      </p>
      <p>
        But we weren’t satisfied with just modifying the repack. We wanted to
        build our own server from scratch, customizing everything from the code
        itself. This led us to explore open-source World of Warcraft servers. It
        felt overwhelming at first, but we persevered, learning how to build the
        C++ server from source using Visual Studio. I had no formal knowledge of
        C++—I simply dove into the code, made changes, debugged errors, and
        resolved issues through trial and error.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this hands-on, problem-solving experience, I developed a deep
        interest in programming and software engineering. The thrill of making
        things work, overcoming challenges, and continuously learning sparked a
        passion that continues to drive me today.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I grew older, I pursued a Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering
        from Montazeri Mashhad University. Over the years, I gained experience
        working for various companies, developing backend systems, APIs, and
        microservices. Today, I’m a Senior Software Engineer specializing in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Backend Development (Node.js, Golang)</li>
        <li>REST APIs & Microservices</li>
        <li>Agile Methodologies</li>
        <li>Docker and Containerization</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My journey, from modifying game servers to building scalable software
        solutions, has been shaped by persistence, curiosity, and a passion for
        continuous learning. I’m excited to keep growing, solving complex
        problems, and creating impactful solutions in the world of backend
        development.
